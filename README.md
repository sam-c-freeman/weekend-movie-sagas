# The Movie Sagas

## Description

_Duration: 2 Day Sprint_

I created a movie app over a weekend.  This app displays all of the current films in the database including: title, poster URL, description and genre.  The user can select a movie poster to see more details about the selected movie.  There is also a form that allows the user to add a new film which will be displayed on the page upon successful completion of the form.  

<!-- To see the fully functional site, please visit: [DEPLOYED VERSION OF APP](www.heroku.com) -->
